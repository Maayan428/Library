## üõ† Design Patterns Used

2. **Factory**:
   - The `FactoryBook` class dynamically creates book objects based on the provided attributes.

3. **Observer**:
   - The notification system alerts users about system events like new arrivals or return of popular books to availability.

4. **Decorator**:
   - Logging functions are decorated to capture success and failure events.
   - All events that are captured are saved into the Action_History.txt file.

## üí° What does Main.py do?

- If the required CSV files for the library system do not exist, `Main.py` will **create and initialize** them.  
- It ensures that all necessary columns are added to the Excel files, resets data, and prepares the system for the first use.
